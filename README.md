# anltr4
## Project will be composed from following steps:

- Using ANTLR, implement a parser for the language specified bellow. If there is at least one syntax error, report this error (or errors) and stop the computations.
- If there are no syntactic errors, perform the type checking. If there are some type errors, report all these errors and stop the computation.
- If there are no type errors, generate appropriate target code. It will be a text file composed from stack-based instructions that are defined bellow.
- Implement an interpreter, that gets a text file with these instructions and evaluates them.
